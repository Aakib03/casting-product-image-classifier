# casting-product-image-classifier
This dataset is of casting manufacturing product. Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mould, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. Reason for collect this data is casting defects!! Casting defect is an undesired irregularity in a metal casting process. There are many types of defect in casting like blow holes, pinholes, burr, shrinkage defects, mould material defects, pouring metal defects, metallurgical defects, etc. Defects are an unwanted thing in casting industry. For removing this defective product all industry have their quality inspection department. But the main problem is this inspection process is carried out manually. It is a very time-consuming process and due to human accuracy, this is not 100% accurate. This can because of the rejection of the whole order. So it creates a big loss in the company.  We decided to make the inspection process automatic and for this, we need to make deep learning classification model for this problem.
